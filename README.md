## PLOT
In 1995, Jimmy "B-Rabbit" Smith Jr. a 23-year-old, unhappy blue-collar worker from a poor Missouri family who now are residing in a trailer park near Detroit in Warren, Michigan. Jimmy has moved back north of 8 Mile Road to the run-down trailer home in Warren, Michigan, of his alcoholic mother Stephanie, his younger sister Lily, and Stephanie's abusive live-in boyfriend Greg. Although encouraged by his friends, Jimmy worries about his potential as a rapper. One night, Jimmy chokes during a rap battle at a local venue, the Shelter, and he leaves the stage humiliated.

During the day, Jimmy works at a car factory, after previously working at a Little Caesar’s Pizza in Warren. Desperate for money, he asks for extra shifts, but his supervisor bluntly dismisses his request because of his habitual tardiness. Later on, Jimmy befriends a woman named Alex, and he begins to take more responsibility for the direction of his life.
